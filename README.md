### Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Using LSTM Networks

---

## Introduction
This repository contains a project that demonstrates the application of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network, to predict cryptocurrency prices. Utilizing Python and libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras, the project aims to forecast price movements based on historical data, offering insights into predictive model building in the domain of financial technology.

## Concept Overview

### Time Series Analysis
Time series analysis involves techniques to analyze time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and characteristics of the data. In this project, time series analysis is crucial for understanding the sequential nature of cryptocurrency prices.

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
RNNs are a class of neural networks designed to handle sequential data. They are capable of maintaining a memory of previous inputs using their internal state, which helps in modeling time-dependent data.

### LSTM Networks
Long Short-Term Memory networks are an advanced type of RNNs capable of learning long-term dependencies in data. They are particularly useful in avoiding the vanishing gradient problem common in traditional RNNs, making them effective for tasks like price prediction where the input sequence is lengthy.

## Data Preparation
The LSTM model is trained on historical cryptocurrency price data. The preparation involves several steps to make the raw data suitable for training the neural network.

### Data Collection
We collect historical price data from sources such as the Yahoo Finance API, focusing on daily closing prices of various cryptocurrencies.

### Code Snippet: Data Collection
```python
import yfinance as yf

# Fetch historical data for Bitcoin
data = yf.download('BTC-USD', start='2019-01-01', end='2024-01-01')
data['Close'].plot(title="Bitcoin Closing Prices")
```

### Data Normalization
Normalization is a crucial step in preprocessing to ensure that the LSTM model receives data within a scale appropriate for neural network training.

### Code Snippet: Data Normalization
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

scaler = MinMaxScaler()
data['Normalized'] = scaler.fit_transform(data['Close'].values.reshape(-1,1))
```

### Training/Test Split
The dataset is divided into training and test sets, typically using a 70/30 or 80/20 split, to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

## Model Architecture
A detailed breakdown of the LSTM model used for price prediction:

### Code Snippet: Model Definition
```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Dropout

model = Sequential([
    LSTM(50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(None, 1)),
    Dropout(0.2),
    LSTM(50),
    Dense(1)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
```

## Training the Model
The training process involves running the model through several epochs to minimize the loss function, using the Adam optimizer and monitoring performance to avoid overfitting.

### Code Snippet: Model Training
```python
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)
```

## Testing and Evaluation
Evaluation of the model is performed using the test data, assessing its accuracy and the precision of its predictions.

### Code Snippet: Model Evaluation
```python
test_loss = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Test Loss: {test_loss}')
```

## Conclusion
This project showcases the effective use of LSTM networks in predicting cryptocurrency prices, providing a foundation for further exploration into more complex financial modeling tasks.

## Future Work
Future improvements could include integrating real-time data feeds, exploring the impact of external factors like market news, and deploying the model as a web-based application for live predictions.
